// Create a client-side file (e.g., client.js) that handles the client-side logic and interacts with the server-side endpoints.
// Move the client-side code from the combined code you provided into the client.js file. This code will handle the client-side functionality, such as handling the dropdown selection and making requests to the server-side endpoints.
// In the client-side code, update the event listener to make an HTTP request to the server-side endpoint instead of logging the selected region to the console.
